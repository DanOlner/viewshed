# Some notes on these files

* **doViewShed.py**: this is taken from [Zoran Cuckovic's QGIS viewshed analysis plugin](http://hub.qgis.org/projects/viewshed/wiki). Source code is in the plugin itself - I copied from there since I know it runs in QGIS, but there's also a [github repo](https://github.com/zoran14/viewshed).
